# Traverse

Traverse lets you easily run the same function on batches of feature routes. Your function will have access to an instance of [Puppeteer Page](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&show=api-class-page) for every route you have in your configuration, making it simple to run things like visual regression tests, accessibility checks, and other types of validations you might want to run on an entire website.

## Example: Take a screenshot per route

This project has a set of example files in the `/examples` folder. Inside you'll find configuration, overrides, and a function that will take a screenshot per route.
